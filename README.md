## Synopsis
  This repository contains materials completed on my journey to FSWB.
  - [C01 - Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bootstrap-4).
  - [C02 - Front-End Web Development with React](https://www.coursera.org/learn/front-end-react).
  - [C03 - Multiplatform Mobile App Development with React Native](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-native).
  - [C04 - Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB](https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-nodejs).

  And some projects to go further (_rather than farther_ as the distance to my goals is _metaphorical_)...
